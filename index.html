        <p class="mt-4 lead">Throughout history, Stoicism has influenced many prominent figures, 
            including presidents, military leaders, and artists. 
            Its principles continue to be relevant today, as people look to 
            find meaning and purpose in an increasingly complex and 
            fast-paced world.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">“This too shall pass” was Lincoln’s favorite saying, one he once said was applicable in any and every situation one could encounter. His plodding patience and stamina was an incredible virtue during the US Civil War, a terrible war that would call on Lincoln to be both forceful and forgiving, violent yet compassionate.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">"Truth is not what you want it to be; it is what it is, and you must bend to its power or live a lie." Musashi's philosophy is one of self reliance, inner calm, acceptance, and discipline. His work is read all over the world to help people develop mental strength and the qualities needed for a resilient and happy life. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality." As a Stoic philosopher writing in Latin, Seneca makes a lasting contribution to Stoicism. He occupies a central place in the literature on Stoicism at the time, and shapes the understanding of Stoic thought that later generations were to have. </p>
