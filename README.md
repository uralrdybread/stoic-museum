# Museum of Stoicism

For this project I'm using a popup museum of stoicism as the theme. 

I was inspired to create this project after learning about how to use an intersection observer in JavaScript to trigger the 
appearance of text on scroll. I also wanted to make the website responsive, so I used Bootstrap components such as cards. 
To enhance the user experience, I designed the cards to appear after the opening text, allowing the user to read the statement 
and then the accompanying information before seeing the cards. The cards feature famous stoic figures, each with a quote and a 
paragraph describing their stoic beliefs. I used simple Bootstrap columns to contain and ensure the responsiveness of this 
midsection.

The navigation bar is bootstrap 5 with some modifitions like menu icon color to fit the them better. The buttons change color on 
mouse hover to fit the color motif.

The background images are generated from midjourney bot. I then took the images and gave them an opacity filter and brush
stroked the borders in gimp to give a better blend.
